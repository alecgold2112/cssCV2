          <h3>Interpersonal Communication</h3>
          <p>Communication in the work place is essential. During my internships, I had the chance to work closely with both my peers and elected officials. Interpersonal communication made my time much more enjoyable and more efficient.</p>

          <h3>Archery</h3>
          <p>Since I was young, I have always had an itch for playing sports. However, being disabled made it hard for me to play the typical youth sports. That was until I found archery. I am now a traveling competitor <em>and instructor</em> for youth archers.</p>

          <h3>Video Games</h3>
          <p>I have always had a strong interest in video games. That is what initially led to my interest in coding, wondering how video games actually became video games. Now, 13 years later, I still game whenever I can.</p>
